This is just an experimental project I'm using to learn a little bit about DDD and MongoDB together. The value types are not completely immutable w/ reflection, because I left private fields open for the BSON serializer. 

Also currently, everything falls in one project. This was only to keep it simple. By design, these components should be easily placed in other assemblies. 

If you have comments or suggestions, shoot me a message.
